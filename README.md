Hi guys!!! This is my own research on how to generate high quality Chinese poetry. Actually, I have two ideas about this work. First, I want to use prompt engineering method like in context learning or COT technique. Second, I want to use RLHF or DPO method to make use of the reasoning or semantic capabilities of large language models. What;s more I have recently been inspired by the magic of RAG, which I hope can help me with my project
